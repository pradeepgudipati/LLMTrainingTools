# ðŸš€ LLMTrainingTools: Your Go-To for LLM Training and Fine-Tuning

* **Chatbots are revolutionizing the way we interact with technology**, and the global chatbot market is projected to reach a staggering **$19.6 billion by 2025**. This growth is powered by the increasing adoption of chatbots and conversational AI across a multitude of industries.

* But there's a catch - **the success of a chatbot is deeply rooted in the quality of its training data**. Inadequate or poor-quality training data can lead to chatbots that misinterpret requests, provide irrelevant responses, or falter when faced with new questions.

* While there are existing datasets for training conversational AI, they often fall short when it comes to catering to your specific use case, such as your unique product data.

* Enter **LLMTrainingTools**, your comprehensive solution for customizing and editing training data. But here's what sets us apart - **we focus solely on LLM Training and Fine-tuning, not the base LLM model**. This allows us to provide a specialized toolset that caters specifically to your training and fine-tuning needs.

* Our suite of utilities is designed to simplify the creation and management of fine-tuning data for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly chatbots. From converting data between CSV, JSONL, and SQLite formats to editing training data via an intuitive web interface, **LLMTrainingTools is your partner in shaping the future of chatbots**.

Join us on this exciting journey and let's redefine the world of chatbots together! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

###  Now to export all these QA pairs in the Db into a JSONL file, run the following command
1. If you have a Question answer CSV base you can convert it to JSONL and then import it to the SQLite DB
2. Click on the "CSV to JSONL" button at the top. Once the conversion is done, you will see a message "CSV to JSONL Conversion Done"
3. Now Import the JSONL into the DB file (SQLite) by clicking on the "Import JSONL to DB" button. Once the import is done, you will see a message "Import JSONL to DB Done"
4. Now you can see the data in the table view. You can edit the data and save it back to the DB by clicking on the "Save to DB" button. Once the save is done, you will see a message "Data Saved to DB"
5. Now to export the data from the DB to JSONL, click on the "Export DB to JSONL" button. Once the export is done, you will see a message "Export DB to JSONL Done"
6. This JSONL file can now be used to train the LLM model. 

# Optional 

###  1. Convert the DB file to JSONL
1. Code for DB to JSONL is in [db_to_jsonl.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fdb_to_jsonl.py).
Verify the path for the jsonl and db files in the code

```python
# Paths for the JSONL file and SQLite database
jsonl_file_path = "data/qa_data.jsonl"
sqlite_db_path = "data/merged_data.db"
```
2. Now run the following command in the terminal to execute the code

```bash
python db_to_jsonl.py
```
###  2. Convert the JSONL file to DB

1. First verify the jsonl and db paths in the [jsonl_to_sqllite.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fjsonl_to_sqllite.py)

```python
jsonl_file_path = "src/data_tools/import_utils/data/qa_data.jsonl"
sqlite_db_path = "data/qa_data.db"
```
2. Run the following command in the terminal to execute the code
```bash 
python jsonl_to_sqllite.py
```

### 3. Convert the CSV file to JSONL

1. First verify the jsonl and csv paths in the[csv_to_jsonl.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fcsv_to_jsonl.py)
 - If you have multiple CSV files then use the below path variable 
```python
# Paths
csv_files_path = './docs'
output_jsonl_file = 'training_data.jsonl'
convert_folder_csv_to_jsonl(csv_files_path, output_jsonl_file)
``` 
 - If you have only 1 CSV file 
```python
# Paths
csv_files_path = './training_data.csv'
output_jsonl_file = 'training_data.jsonl'
convert_single_csv_to_jsonl(csv_file_path, output_jsonl_file)
```

2. Execute the code 
```bash 
python csv_to_jsonl.py
```

# More Details 

### 1. JSONL to DB - 

- JSONL to SQLite DB Converter Code -  [jsonl_to_sqllite.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fjsonl_to_sqllite.py)

This python code converts the jsonl data to a sqllite database with a table called messages. 
The messages table has 3 rows

1. id - Primary key
2. Question - Contains the Question
3. Answer - Contains the answer to the Question

### 2. DB to JSONL 
 - SQLite to JSONL Converter code - [db_to_jsonl.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fdb_to_jsonl.py)

This code converts the sqlite database to a jsonl file
The format of the jsonl is as follows

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": ""
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Flask Application for editing the training data

- Flask Server App Code - [app.py](src/app.py)
- Flask HTML Template - [table_view.html](templates%2Ftable_view.html)
- Data Model [llm_training_data_model.py](models%2Fllm_training_data_model.py)

### 4. Training files

1. JSONL Data File - [qa_data.jsonl](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fdata%2Fqa_data.jsonl)
2. SQLite DB file - [qa_data.db](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fdata%2Fqa_data.db)

### 5. CSV to JSONL File
- CSV to JSONL Converter -  [csv_to_jsonl.py](jsonl_data_to_db%2Fcsv_to_jsonl.py)

## Running the application 
Start the Flask server by running the below command in the terminal
```bash
 python app.py
```
Access the Web UI by opening the below URL in your favorite browser
http://localhost:5000
